# ShardGate Brand Rules

This document defines the complete and final brand system for ShardGate. No legacy brands exist. These rules are authoritative.

**Company Pitch:** ShardGate is an indie game studio creating original games and high-quality Minecraft content.

## 1. Brand Identity

ShardGate is an indie game studio producing games and Minecraft-related projects under a single parent brand.

There are **labels**, not sub-brands:

Labels describe project scope only. They never override the parent brand.

**Minecraft Project Aesthetic:** All ShardGate MC projects follow a green-centric aesthetic to visually differentiate Minecraft-related content.
